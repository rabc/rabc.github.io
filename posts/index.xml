      <description>SwiftNIO is pretty much a low-level framework, where you need to understand concepts from the event-driven and network worlds, but ultimately what it is exposed in final frameworks like Vapor are its Futures and Promises events.
John Sundell has a good definition about it:
 A Promise is something you make to someone else. In the Future you may choose to honor (resolve) that promise, or reject it.  Go read his post about it for a great introduction of the concept.</description>

      <description>Why this blog Humans are lazy by nature (there is a chance that someone is reading this post right now to avoid picking-up the next Jira ticket, for example). It is too easy to lock ourselves inside our knowledge silos and keep doing the same thing. Maybe you need a routine and predictability, maybe you think you do well this one thing.
Whatever the reason, it is fine. Because at the same time, humans are curious by nature too.</description>
