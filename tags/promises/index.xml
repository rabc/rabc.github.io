      <description>SwiftNIO is pretty much a low-level framework, where you need to understand concepts from the event-driven and network worlds, but ultimately what it is exposed in final frameworks like Vapor are its Futures and Promises events.
John Sundell has a good definition about it:
 A Promise is something you make to someone else. In the Future you may choose to honor (resolve) that promise, or reject it.  Go read his post about it for a great introduction of the concept.</description>
